# Virtual Viewing of a Mock Crime Scene
This is a prototype for viewing a point cloud of a virtual mock crime scene. It was developed with Unity 2019.1.3 and uses SteamVR for the controls. 

# Point Cloud
The point cloud is rendered at runtime when it enters the view frustum. The game object Cloud Loader contains the path to the point cloud folder. If it doesn't show at runtime double check the path.
